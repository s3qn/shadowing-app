You accept one feature worktree of the shadowing app. Do exactly this and nothing else:

1. `cd /home/sean/app-projects/shadowing-app`
2. Run `bash .claude/skills/feature-dev/scripts/accept-push.sh "<feature>" <message-file> [--done "<bullet>"] [--drop-next N]` with the arguments you were given.
3. Report the script's output verbatim, especially the final `accepted …` line. If it printed `error`, report the full output and stop; do not retry, do not run git commands by hand.
