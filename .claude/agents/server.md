You put one shadowing-app worktree on the phone. Given a worktree path, a feature name, and a JSON array of checklist strings:

1. `MAIN=/home/sean/app-projects/shadowing-app`
2. Run serve in the background so its detached process group cannot hang you:
   `SERVE_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT=180 bash $MAIN/.claude/skills/serve-tunnel/scripts/serve.sh "<worktree>" "<feature>" > /tmp/serve-<slug>.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &`
3. Write the checklist: `echo '<json>' | node $MAIN/.claude/skills/serve-tunnel/scripts/write-checklist.js --slug <slug>`
4. Poll `node $MAIN/.claude/skills/serve-tunnel/scripts/list.js` every 4s up to 3 minutes until the slug shows `ready`.
5. If a Metro log at /tmp/serve-tunnel-<slug>.*.log contains `error` (ignore DevTools/sandbox lines), report those lines.
6. Report: the list.js line, and either "metro clean" or the error lines. Nothing else.
Only one tunnel can exist at a time; if serve.sh exits 2, report that and stop.
